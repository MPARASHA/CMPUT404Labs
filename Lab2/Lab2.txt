Q1. To specify a TCP socket in python we make use of the socket module. While creating the socket we specify the address family
and the socket type. In client.py we used AF_INET address family which represents IPv4 Addresses. Socket type for TCP is SOCK_STREAM.
After this we use the host's ip and port number to make a TCP connection.


Q2. Server sockets use bind() to be bounded to the host and a port. The client sockets connect to the sever sockets using connect().


Q3. Server socket we used in echo_server.py set the SOL_SOCKET option of SO_REUSEADDR to 1. This will forcibly bind sockets 
already in use. For AF_INET sockets this means that a socket may bind, except when there is an active listening socket bound to the address.

Q4. We could get the client's ip and port. For example: Connected by ('127.0.0.1', 59834). In this example the IP is localhost and 
port is 59834.
