Q1. To specify a TCP socket in python we make use of the socket module. While creating the socket we specify the address family
and the socket type. In client.py we used AF_INET address family which represents IPv4 Addresses. Socket type for TCP is SOCK_STREAM.
After this we use the host's ip and port number to make a TCP connection.
