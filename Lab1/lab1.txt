Q5. We get 301 status code. 301 means the URL of the requested resource has been changed permanently. 
To get a 200 status code the request needs to be successful. We can get 200 status code by using the url http://www.google.com/ .


Q6. with both -i (without redirect) and -iL (with redirect) we get status code 418 (I'm a teapot). 
Using curl on http://www.google.com/teapot, we get the html document of that page.

Q7. Using POST request method we were able to send data and we were able to add form fields. This chane looks like this in HTML:

    <DL>
    <DT>X: <i>&lt;type 'instance'&gt;</i>
    <DD>MiniFieldStorage('X', 'Y')
    </DL>

    Post method is useful in sending data in requests like forms.
