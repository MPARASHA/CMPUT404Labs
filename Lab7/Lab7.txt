Q1. Django is a python framework for full-stack web development, while 
    Flask is a light-weight micro web framework written in Python focused on API. 
    Django provides features like admin panel,  authentication middleware and ORM support which are not avaiable for Flask users.

Q2. REST is an abbreviation for representational state transfer.
    For something to be RESTful it needs to follow REST constraints.

Q3. CRUD is an abbreviation for Create, Read, Update, Delete. 
    POST, GET, PUT, DELETE are the corresponding HTTP methods.

Q5. XSS attack or Cross-site scripting is a type of security vulnerability 
    which allows for attackers to inject client-side javascript into web pages to be viewed by other users (1).
    An example of XSS vulnerability could be from a website's search or contact form. 
    An attacker could store a malicious script in the data sent through them (2).

Q6. CORS is an abbreviation for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. 
    It is a mechanism that loosens the restrictions posed by same origin policy 
    and allows for scripts running on a browser to interact with resources on an external origin. 
    This mechanism is blocked by default. 
    But we can enable it if we are in a situation where we want to run scripts that interact with external resources.
